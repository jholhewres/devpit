//! Listening to the panes devpit-ptyd holds, whether or not a window is on
//! them: [`crate::tap`]'s `pipe-pane`, for the daemon.
//!
//! One connection per home sends `Watch` — what each pane runs and where —
//! and attaches every ptyd leaf the layouts have, and each new one as it is
//! opened. What a pane prints is cut into blocks there as tmux's copy is, so
//! a long command's end is told with no window open.
//!
//! The daemon keeps one count of unacknowledged output per pane, and every
//! attached client's `Ack` takes from it, but a mirror's (`ptyd-attach`) while
//! another watcher is on. A window acks what its page parsed; the tap acks
//! only while no window is on the pane ([`acked`]).
