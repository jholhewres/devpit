//! `checkpoint.preview` — what a step would run, before anybody runs it.
//!
//! A check is somebody else's command against your machine and your checkout.
//! Offering it behind a button that says only "Run" asks for trust the screen
//! has not earned: the same word can be `pnpm test` and can be a deploy.
//!
//! So the command, the directory, the environment devpit declares and the
//! timeout are all said first. Nothing here starts anything — running is
//! `card.play`, which already runs the card's lane where it stands and does
//! not move the card.
