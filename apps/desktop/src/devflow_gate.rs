//! `devflow_gate`: a card judged on its evidence — by the agent that calls
//! `devpit_devflow_gate`, or by devpit's own hook when one of its turns ends
//! — and `devflow_session`, the card a session starts on. A failing gate
//! also holds `devpit_finish_card`.
//!
//! The rules are `devpit_devflow::gate`'s; this reads the run, the review
//! and the checkout, asks Decisions, keeps each session's streak, and tells
