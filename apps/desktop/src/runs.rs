//! Starting a step, and recording what it did.
//!
//! A run is opened before the work begins and closed when it ends, so a card
//! never has work happening with nothing on screen to show for it. When the
//! process dies mid-run the row stays `running` and says so — which is honest,
//! and better than a row that silently reports success.
//!
//! **The work happens off the command's thread.** A turn takes seconds; doing
//! it inline would freeze the drag that started it for exactly as long, and a
//! board that locks up while it thinks is a board nobody drags things onto.
//! The command returns a `running` row and the thread finishes it, announcing
//! itself on `run:changed` so the card can catch up.
//!
//! Nothing here retries. A failed run leaves the card where it is with the
//! reason on it, and the next move is a person's.
