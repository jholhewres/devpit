//! Carrying out one step, on the thread that owns it.

//! Apart from `runs.rs` because that file opens the row and hands it over, and
//! this is the work itself — which is most of the volume and none of the
//! bookkeeping.
//!
//! Everything here happens off the thread that draws. A step is a process, or
//! several; doing it inline would freeze the drag that started it for exactly
//! as long, and a board that locks up while it thinks is a board nobody drags
//! things onto.
