//! What an orchestrator's sessions did since its last turn, said at the top
//! of its next one.
//!
//! A session that finishes does not wake the orchestrator: a turn it did not
//! ask for spends the person's money and talks over them. devpit remembers
//! how the sessions stood when the orchestrator last spoke, and the next turn
//! the person starts begins with the difference — "since your last message:
//! api-worker finished its turn" — so the orchestrator is never the last to
//! know and never speaks unasked.
