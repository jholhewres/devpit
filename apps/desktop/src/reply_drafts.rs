//! Replies an orchestrator drafts for the person to send as theirs.
//!
//! A message from the orchestrator approves nothing in another session — the
//! CLI treats it as coming from the orchestrator, and rightly. What the person
//! says in the orchestrator's chat used to stop there: to let a session go on,
//! they had to find its tab and type it again. So the orchestrator writes the
//! words and the window shows them beside the session; the person sends them,
//! edits them or drops them, and only their click types anything.
//!
//! Held in memory, one per session: a draft is for now, and one that outlived
//! the app would offer words about a moment that has passed.
