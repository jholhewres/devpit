//! The bell, and what rings it.
//!
//! Nothing here invents an event. Every notice is something the app already
//! knew and had nowhere to say: a run ended, an agent stopped and is waiting
//! for a person, a card went past its date. The bell is the place they were
//! missing, not a new source of them.
//!
//! Written where the thing happens and read here, rather than polled: a timer
//! that asks "did anything happen" finds out late and finds out repeatedly.
//! The one exception is deadlines, which are not an event at all — nothing
//! *happens* when a date passes, so something has to look.
