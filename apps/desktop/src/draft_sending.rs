//! A draft sent at the orchestrator's call, on the person's own word.
//!
//! The orchestrator asks (`devpit_send_draft`); devpit reads the person's last
//! message in the orchestrator's log itself and sends only when that message
//! lets this draft go (`devpit_agentcli::person`). So a ✅ counts from
//! wherever the person spoke to the orchestrator — the composer or the Claude
//! app — and never from another session, a tool or the agent's own account.
//! One message lets one draft go: a second ask on the same words is refused.
//! Words that do not let it go leave it waiting for the person's click, and
//! from a channel's chat a word lets nothing go: there it is their press.
