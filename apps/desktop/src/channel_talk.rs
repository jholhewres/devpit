//! The person talking to an orchestrator from a channel's paired chat: a
//! message or a voice note in, the orchestrator's answer out.
//!
//! A transport hands in what the paired chat said — Telegram through the
//! person's own bot, or through devpit.app's (`telegram_devpit`) — and only
//! the paired chat: a message from any other never reaches here. It becomes
//! the person's turn in the orchestrator's chat through the composer's own
//! door, marked with its channel. While that turn runs, what it would do on the person's consent —
//! send a draft, stop a session, start a lane's step — becomes a button under
//! the answer, and only the press does it: a yes typed or heard on a phone is
//! the agent's reading of words, a button says exactly what it does.
