//! A chat's conversation, kept running between turns.
//!
//! Its process stays (`devpit_agentcli::resident`) and the person's turns are
//! lines on its stdin: a turn starts without starting the CLI, a model or mode
//! switch is a control request, and Stop interrupts the turn, the same way in
//! every chat. A chat's process goes after a while idle, and its next turn
//! resumes the session in a new one; one that dies is replaced the same way.
//!
//! An orchestrator's never idles out. It is also spoken to by the sessions it
//! follows — "done", "blocked", the notice it asked for when one went idle —
//! and those reach only a process that is still there. A turn some other
//! session wakes is written into the conversation here, streamed through the
//! relay, and announced so an open chat joins it.
//!
//! Only outside the supervised mode: asking before a tool runs is held per
//! turn by the window that sent it, and a woken turn has no such window.
