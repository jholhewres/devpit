//! Talking to the orchestrators and their sessions from the Remote: what

//! recordings a phone sends in pieces.
//!
//! A turn goes through the composer's own `chat.send`, marked as the
//! Remote's, and reaches the device the way it reaches a chat reopened
//! mid-turn: joined through `chat_relay`. A session's words are its own
//! transcript, and a message to it is typed into its terminal as the person.
