//! Core of devpit.
//!
//! All product logic lives here and in the other `crates/`. The desktop shell,
//! the HTTP server and the CLI are thin adapters over it.
//!
//! The rule that holds the design together — checked by `cargo xtask check` —
//! is that nothing under `crates/` imports `tauri`. That is what keeps the
//! shell choice reversible: if WebKitGTK on Linux rules Tauri out, swapping
//! shells costs days instead of months.
