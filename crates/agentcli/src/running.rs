//! A profile, as something that can be started.
//!
//! Three fields, and which of them a caller can honour is the whole reason
//! this type exists rather than a command string:
//!
//!   - **Spawned** — the board's headless turns and the chat. `Command::new`
//!     takes the program, the arguments and the environment separately and
//!     hands each over untouched. Nothing is parsed, so nothing can be
//!     misparsed.
//!   - **Typed** — a terminal, where tmux sends a line of text to a shell.
//!     There the three have to become one string, and `line` is the only place
//!     in the product that does it.
//!
//! A command string would have collapsed those two into the weaker one, and
//! would have been unable to express the case that started all of this: `glm`
//! is `claude` with seven variables in front of it and no shell involved.
