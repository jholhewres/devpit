//! Talking to a turn while it runs.
//!
//! In stream-json input mode the CLI reads control requests on stdin for as
//! long as stdin is open — measured on Claude Code 2.1.270: a `stop_task` was
//! answered within a tenth of a second by the task ending as `killed`. So a
//! turn keeps its stdin, and this is the handle to it.
//!
//! When to close it is the decision here. Closed at the first `result` the
//! process exits a second later; closed while a background task still runs,
//! that task may be cut off before the wake-up pass it would have caused. So
//! it closes once both are true: a result has arrived and nothing is running.
