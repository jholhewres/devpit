//! One headless turn: run it, read the stream, report what it cost.
//!
//! This is the cheap half of the product. It takes no terminal, it declares a
//! spending cap before it starts, and the last line of its output says what it
//! actually spent — which is how a card stops saying "the agent is doing
//! something" and starts saying a number.
