//! Ending a command run, and everything it started.
//!
//! A command step is almost never one process. `make test` is `sh`'s child and
//! `cargo` is its grandchild and the test binary is its great-grandchild, and
//! signalling the shell alone leaves the suite running under a card that says
//! it stopped. That is worse than no Cancel at all: the window reports an end
//! that did not happen, and the next run fights the last one for the port, the
//! lock file, the tmux pane.
//!
//! So the shell is given a session of its own at spawn, which makes it the
//! leader of a process group nothing else is in, and the whole group is
//! signalled together. The group exists because this module created it — this
//! never signals a group it did not make, which is also why the tmux server,
//! living in its own session, is out of reach here by construction.
