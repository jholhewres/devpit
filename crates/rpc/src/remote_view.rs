//! Reaching this machine from another device: what the viewer and the host
//! say to each other, and what the settings show about it.
//!
//! The viewer is a page this machine serves over the person's tailnet, or
//! devpit.app serves to reach it through the relay. It speaks JSON, a message
//! at a time, tagged by `t`: one per WebSocket frame on the tailnet, sealed in
//! Noise frames through the relay (`docs/remote-relay.md`). What
//! it may do is decided here, on the machine, per paired device: every
//! device sees; typing and answering are granted one by one.
