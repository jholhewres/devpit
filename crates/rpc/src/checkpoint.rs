//! Three questions about a run, kept apart because they have three answers.
//!
//! *Did the process end well?* is [`RunState`], which already exists and is
//! not touched here. *Did the thing it was checking pass?* is [`Result`]. *Is
//! that still true of the code in front of you?* is [`Validity`].
//!
//! Collapsing them is the mistake this module exists to prevent. Exit code
//! zero proves the **command** succeeded, not that the tests passed: a runner
//! that could not find a test file exits zero and runs nothing. A run nobody
//! reaped is `Lost`, and `Lost` is never `Passed` however green the last line
//! looked. And a result from two commits ago is not wrong — it is about other
//! code, which is a different thing from being wrong and reads differently on
//! a screen.
//!
//! Everything here is a function of its arguments, so the screen and the
//! backend cannot disagree about what a row means.
