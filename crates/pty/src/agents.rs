//! The agent CLIs, and how to tell one is running.
//!
//! One list, two uses, and that is the point: the menu that starts an agent
//! and the reader that recognises one have to agree, or starting Gemini from
//! our own menu opens a terminal the sidebar then says is running `node`.
//!
//! Recognition works on the argument vector, never on the executable's name.
//! Claude Code, Codex, Gemini and OpenCode are JavaScript, so the process is
//! `node` and the name is in `argv[1]`. Skipping the interpreter is therefore
//! most of the job, and it has to skip its *options* too: `node -e "…"` is not
//! an agent no matter what the script says, and `node --require x claude` is.
//!
//! Only a path-shaped argument counts as the program being run. Without that
//! rule `claude "compare opencode and codex"` reads its own prompt back and
//! calls itself OpenCode.
