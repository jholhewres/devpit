## What it is

A desktop app that keeps your coding agents in view: one terminal you are
watching, a board that says where each piece of work stands, and the cost of
every agent call.

## What it does

- **One target terminal per project**; other sessions keep running in the background.
- **Sessions that outlive the window**: they are tmux sessions.
- **A git worktree per card**, made when a step needs one.
- **A board per project** whose columns run steps: an agent, a session or your own command.
- **A spending cap on every agent call**, and the real cost on the card.
- **An orchestrator** chat that sees every project and can hand work to sessions.
- **A browser pane** for the page your project serves.
- **File tree and diffs** beside the terminal.
- **Local first**: everything lives in `~/.devpit`; an account is optional.
