 * Where this card's work happens, and how to start doing it.
 *
 * The join the board was missing. A card described a piece of work and had no
 * way to begin it: the checkout was made only as a side-effect of a step
 * running, and the terminal knew nothing about cards. Both already existed;
 * neither was reachable from here.
 *
 * "Open a terminal" makes the checkout if there is none, because a person
 * pressing it is asking for exactly that — a place to work, in this card's own
 * branch, not an error about a folder they never heard of.
