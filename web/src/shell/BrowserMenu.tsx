/*
 * Everything a browser pane can be told to do, in one panel.
 *
 * There were three controls before this: a key that opened an import form, a
 * chip that opened a session list, and sign-out inside the import panel next
 * to the routine action. Each was reasonable alone and together they were a
 * bar with three menus in it and no idea which held what.
 *
 * **This draws the panel and nothing around it.** It has no trigger and no
 * open state, because it does not live in the pane's document: a pane's page
 * is a second native webview and two native webviews have no z-order between
 * them, so a panel drawn beside the pane came out *behind the site*.
 * `BrowserMenuWindow` renders this in a window of its own, which the operating
 * system stacks for us. The trigger is a plain button back in the bar.
 *
 * The order is a browser's, and each rule in it separates things that do
 * different kinds of damage:
 *
 *   ✓ default                which session this pane is in
 *   ✓ work
 *   ───
 *   + New session…
 *   ───
 *   ⇩ Bring a signed-in session  ▸   browser ▸ profile
 *   ───
 *   ▭ Page width                 ▸
 *   ───
 *     Let an agent drive this page
 *   ───
 *     Sign out of “default”          the one with no undo, on its own
 *
 * **The import cascade asks browser first, then profile.** They arrive from
 * Rust as two fields for exactly this: somebody looking for a login thinks
 * *the Chrome one*, then *my work Chrome*, and a flat list of
 * `Google Chrome · Profile 1` makes them read the browser name five times to
 * find the profile.
 *
 * **What an import takes is said before it is offered, not after.** Picking a
 * profile brings that profile's cookies — all of them, which is what makes the
 * feature work at all and is also more than somebody may mean. The row says
 * so, and the field above it narrows to one site for anybody who wants that.
