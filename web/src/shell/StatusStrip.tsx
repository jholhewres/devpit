/*
 * A strip along the bottom, saying what is running.
 *
 * It exists to answer one question without being asked — "is something eating
 * this machine" — which people otherwise answer by opening another program. So
 * it is two numbers and a count, and everything else is behind a click.
 *
 * It stays put. The first version hid itself whenever nothing was measured,
 * which made "nothing is running" and "this is broken" the same picture:
 * somebody opened the window, looked for the strip, and found nothing to tell
 * them which. What it does instead is go quiet — with no terminals it says so
 * in words and shows no figures, because `0% · 0 MB` is a line the eye learns
 * to skip and then misses when it matters.
