/*
 * What the focus held, shown on the way out.
 *
 * This is the other half of the promise: nothing that arrived while the door
 * was shut is dropped, and it is not shown as a wall of rings the moment the
 * focus ends either — it is one list, grouped by the project it came from,
 * because three things from one subsystem read as one thing and three things
 * from three read as three.
 *
 * Read through `focus.waiting` rather than from the bell's own list: the bell
 * holds a page of the newest, and a focus is exactly the case where what
 * matters fell off the end of it.
 *
 * Nothing here is marked read by being shown. Acting on one is what reads it.
