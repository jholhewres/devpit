 * What this card has changed, against where it started.
 *
 * Against `base_ref` and never against HEAD — which is the whole reason the
 * card records one. A card branched three days ago and compared to today's
 * main would report every commit somebody else made as its own work.
 *
 * Asked for rather than loaded: a diff is a `git diff` over a whole checkout,
 * and most of the time somebody opening a card wants to read its description.
 * The button says how much there is once it knows.
