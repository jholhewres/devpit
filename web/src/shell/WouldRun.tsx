 * What a check would do, before anybody runs it.
 *
 * A check is somebody else's command against your machine and your checkout.
 * A button that says only "Run" asks for trust this screen has not earned —
 * the same word can be `pnpm test` and can be a deploy — so the command, the
 * directory, the environment devpit declares and the timeout are said first.
 *
 * Nothing here starts anything. Running is `card.play`, which runs the lane
 * where the card stands and does not move it.
