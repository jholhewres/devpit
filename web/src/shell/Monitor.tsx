 * What each terminal is costing.

 * By pane rather than by process, because a pane is the thing you can act on:
 * `node` twice over says nothing, and "Claude Code, three processes, 1.06 GB"
 * says what to close.
 *
 * The whole tree under each pane is counted. An agent's cost is mostly its
 * children — the language server, the MCP servers it spawned — and a number
 * that leaves them out is a number saying an agent is free.
