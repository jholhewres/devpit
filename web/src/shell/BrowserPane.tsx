 * A page, in a webview that is not ours.
 *
 * What this component draws is a **hole**. The page itself is a second native
 * webview inside the same window, placed over this element in window
 * coordinates — it is not an iframe and it is not inside this document, which
 * is the whole point: the page cannot reach what devpit draws, and devpit's
 * commands are scoped to the `main` webview so the page cannot call them
 * either.
 *
 * Two consequences the rest of the file is about:
 *
 * 1. **Nothing moves it but us.** A native webview knows nothing about the
 *    layout that decided where it goes, so every resize and every scroll has
 *    to be measured here and sent over.
 * 2. **Nothing hides it but us.** It floats above the window. A pane that
 *    scrolls out of view, or a tab that stops being the visible one, leaves a
 *    page sitting over whatever is there now unless this closes it.
