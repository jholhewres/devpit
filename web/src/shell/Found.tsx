 * What a review found, under the run that found it.

 * a list of runs is not a place to send everything every review said.
 *
 * A review made against another revision says so and keeps its own line
 * numbers. Following them through a diff would be a guess dressed as a fact,
 * and a finding pointing confidently at the wrong line is worse than one that
 * admits its age.
