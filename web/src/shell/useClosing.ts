/*
 * Closing a terminal that is still doing something.
 *
 * Between the cross and the strip, because the question "is anything running
 * in this tab" is one the strip cannot answer: it draws tabs, and what is
 * running belongs to panes. Closing a terminal tab kills every tmux window
 * under it, so a stray click on a cross is the difference between an agent
 * finishing its task and an agent that never comes back.
 *
 * The prompt can be turned off, and only by ticking a box — never by a
 * default, and never by pressing Enter twice in a row. See `StopRunning`.
