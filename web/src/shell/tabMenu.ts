 * whether every entry does something, which the `a_control_either_works_or_
 * goes` guard cannot — it checks that a handler exists, not that the handler
 * has anything to call.
 *
 * What Orca offers here and this does not: Pin. Nothing pins, and an entry
 * that cannot be wired leaves the screen — AGENTS.md is explicit — so it is
 * absent rather than greyed out.
