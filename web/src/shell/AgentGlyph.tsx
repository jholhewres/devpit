/*
 * A mark for each agent.
 *
 * Drawn and not fetched. A desktop app that needs the network to draw its own
 * settings pane looks broken on a plane, and the favicon services every other
 * product reaches for are a third party watching which agents somebody has
 * installed.
 *
 * They are devpit's marks, not the vendors' logos — geometric, distinct at
 * thirteen pixels, and making no claim to be anybody's brand. What they have
 * to do is let the eye find a row again, which is all an icon in a list does.
