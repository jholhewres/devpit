/*
 * Where new worktrees are created.
 *
 * It was a constant and the constant is still the default, which is why the
 * field can be empty and mean something. The two answers it exists for:
 *
 *   a relative path   the checkouts live inside the project and travel with it
 *   an absolute path  one folder holds every project, on whichever disk
 *
 * The resolved path is shown under the field rather than explained above it.
 * "Relative or absolute" is a sentence about paths; a path is an answer.
 *
 * Refusals come from the backend and are printed as they arrive. The field
 * keeps what was typed — a box that clears itself on a refusal makes you type
 * the whole thing again to find out what was wrong with it.
