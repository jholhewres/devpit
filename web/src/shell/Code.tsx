/*
 * An editor with colour, which is a textarea with a painting behind it.
 *
 * Not an editor component. A real one would bring its own text model, its own
 * undo stack and its own idea of what a keystroke is — and this app has
 * already had to be careful about exactly that: `typing.ts` exists because a
 * dead key sends `Enter` to commit an accent, and the fix only holds where the
 * browser's own field is doing the typing. A textarea keeps selection, undo,
 * autocorrect, composition and every accessibility affordance the platform
 * has, for free and correctly.
 *
 * So the textarea stays, made transparent, and a `<pre>` behind it draws the
 * same text in colour. The two must agree on every pixel of layout or the
 * caret drifts from the letters, which is why both take their metrics from one
 * class and the box scrolls as a whole rather than each half scrolling itself.
 */

/*
 * Makes an edit the way the browser would have.
 *
 * `execCommand('insertText')` first, and that is the whole reason edits are
 * expressed as a range and a replacement: it is the only way to change a
 * textarea that keeps the browser's own undo stack. Assigning the value
 * instead makes every Tab the end of history, and ⌘Z jumps past an hour of
 * typing.
 *
 * It is deprecated, with no replacement that keeps undo, so the fallback has
 * to be real. Not "if it returns false" — it can be **absent**, and calling a
 * missing function throws where the first version of this crashed the pane
 * instead of indenting. Absent, refusing, or throwing all land in the same
 * place: the text goes back through React, and undo is what is lost rather
 * than the keystroke.
