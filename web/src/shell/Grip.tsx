/*
 * The edge between a side panel and the work.
 *
 * A `separator` and not a decoration: it is in the tab order, it says how wide
 * it is, and the arrow keys move it. A divider you can only reach with a mouse
 * is a window somebody cannot arrange without one — and this one is four
 * pixels wide, which is a hard target with a trackpad and an impossible one
 * without a pointer at all.
 *
 * The pointer is captured on the way down, so a drag that leaves the element —
 * which every drag does, immediately — keeps arriving here rather than being
 * delivered to whatever is underneath.
