/*
 * Finding text in the page, from a bar that belongs to devpit.
 *
 * The page is a webview of its own and its own Ctrl-F is the engine's — which
 * on WebKitGTK is nothing at all, because a webview is not a browser window.
 * So the shortcut has to be caught here, in the window that draws the pane,
 * and the search run inside the page through `window.find`.
 *
 * **It cannot say `3 of 17`.** `window.find` answers whether it moved, not how
 * many matches exist, and no other way to ask exists from inside the page. So
 * this bar shows the box, Enter and Shift-Enter, and stays quiet about a count
 * it would have to invent.
