/*
 * Play: do this lane's step on this card, now.
 *
 * One meaning, and only one. A lane with no step says so and leaves the
 * terminal to the button below it in the same section — it used to draw a
 * second "Open a terminal" right above the first.
 *
 * What it does NOT ask is most of what Orca's dialog asks. The card already
 * carries the work: its title, its description, its files, its conversation.
 * Project, "run on", and the whole Smart/GitHub/Linear/Jira row exist to
 * *discover* a task from somewhere else, and here the task is the thing you
 * clicked.
